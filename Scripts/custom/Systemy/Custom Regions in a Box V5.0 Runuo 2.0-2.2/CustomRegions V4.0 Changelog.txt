- Fixed some spelling mistakes
	- All instances of "AllowBenifit" changed to "AllowBenefit".

- Prevention of identical RegionName
	- On Deserialize, if a region control has the same RegionName as another the region it will have a 1 or 2 etc. added to its name to distinguish it.
	For eg. If a region is called "Custom Region" and another region is already called "Custom Region" it will get called "Custom Region 1", if "Custom Region 1" already exists too then it will be called "Custom Region 2" etc. This is because of the new way that Regions are registered on to maps in RunUO 2.0.
	- On creation, a new Region Control will be called "Custom Region" and as before each new "Custom Region" will have a number added after its name.
	- On setting of RegionName, if a Region Control already exists with the RegionName that the user tries to specify by using [props etc. the RegionName will not be changed and a Warning will be displayed in the Console.
